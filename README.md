# File Text Search using Rabin-Karp Algorithm
This project reads text from a file, takes a search pattern as input, and utilises the Rabin-Karp algorithm to find and report the occurrences of the pattern within the text.
By leveraging hashing and indexing techniques, users can swiftly search through extensive datasets without the need for exhaustive manual inspection. This project offers users a time-saving solution for information retrieval, enabling them to efficiently pinpoint relevant content within their files with ease and precision.

## Features
The features of this project include:
* **Efficient Search Capability:** Users can search for specific strings or patterns within text files quickly, even in large datasets.
* **Accurate Results:** The project employs the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which ensures accurate matching of search queries with text content, minimizing false positives.
* **Customisable Search Parameters:** Users can customise search parameters such as case sensitivity, whole word matching, and search within specific directories or file types.
